This is to *prevent an accidental publish of your code*.","> If you want to learn more about the inner workings of `package.json`, then we recommend reading the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)."]}]},{"name":"Creating a Bundle","commit":"cfadaa6","explain":["First we'll tweak our directory structure slightly, separating the \"source\" code (`/src`) from our \"distribution\" code (`/dist`). The \"source\" code is the code that we'll write and edit. The \"distribution\" code is the **minimized** and **optimized** `output` of our build process that will eventually be loaded in the browser.","To bundle the `lodash` dependency with `index.js`, we'll need to install the library locally:","```bash\nnpm install --save lodash\n```","> When installing a package that will be bundled into your production bundle, you should use `npm install --save`. If you're installing a package for *development purposes* (e.g. a linter, testing libraries, etc.) then you should use `npm install --save-dev`. More information can be found in the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)."],"diff":[{"file":"src/index.js","explain":"Import `lodash` in our script."},{"file":"dist/index.html","explain":"Since we'll be bundling our scripts, we have to update our index.html file. Let's remove the lodash `<script>`, as we now import it, and modify the other `<script>` tag to load the bundle, instead of the raw `/src` file."}]},{"name":"Using a Configuration","commit":"e0826b9","explain":"As of version 4, webpack doesn't require any configuration, but most projects will need a more complex setup, which is why webpack supports a [configuration file](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/configuration). This is much more efficient than having to manually type in a lot of commands in the terminal, so let's create one to replace the CLI line options used above.","diff":[{"file":"webpack.config.js"}]}]}
